## Written on the Crack of 2021

It's time for a new website!  I've been putting this off for a long time.

When I was in college I wrote my own PHP blog site and posted a lot of short snippets of useful C++ code and random ideas related to erasure codes: http://catid.mechafetus.com/  Unfortunately this site is now broken and I don't think the content is worth saving.

I had a false start with a new static page blog website, but didn't find the time to work on it so it never hosted anything interesting.

New year, new blog!
